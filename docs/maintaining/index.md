# Maintaining Gonogo

This section is for whoever maintains the deployed Gonogo: the hosted site, the container images, and how a release candidate and a release are cut. It is not for Uplink authors, who want the [Guide](/guide/). Players setting Gonogo up want the [README](https://github.com/ksp-gonogo/gonogo#readme) and its [networking page](https://github.com/ksp-gonogo/gonogo/blob/main/docs/NETWORKING.md).

## Frontend (GitHub Pages)

> **Where the work goes.** Day-to-day work lands on `staging`, which deploys nothing by itself. The release-candidate channel is built from `staging` by `rc.yml`, nightly and on demand; `main` moves only when a release is cut. The remote default branch is `main`, on purpose: it is the real latest version, what a new visitor sees. See Release and RC channels below.

The site is [ksp-gonogo.github.io](https://ksp-gonogo.github.io/), served by GitHub Pages from the `main` branch of the `ksp-gonogo/ksp-gonogo.github.io` repository. That repository is a deploy target and is never edited by hand. It holds several tenants, each at its own path:

| Path | What | Written by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/` | the landing page, `docs/homepage/index.html` | `deploy.yml`, release channel |
| `/app/` (stations: `/app/station`) | the latest release of the app | `deploy.yml`, release channel |
| `/rc/` (stations: `/rc/station`) | the release-candidate app | `deploy.yml`, rc channel |
| `/gonogo/...` | redirects from the old project-page URLs, keeping the query string and hash | `deploy.yml`, release channel |
| `README.md` (in the repository, not on the site) | one link to this repository, written once and then kept | `deploy.yml`, release channel |

The Uplink developer docs at `ksp-gonogo.github.io/uplink-dev-docs/` are not in that repository: GitHub serves that path from the `uplink-dev-docs` repository's own Pages, and nothing here writes under it.

The workflow is `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`, called by `rc.yml` with `channel=rc` and dispatched by `release.yml` with `channel=release`; nothing triggers it on a push. A run checks the site repository out, writes its own channel's paths with `scripts/pages-compose.mjs`, and commits exactly those paths, so an RC cannot disturb the release. The one shared file is the empty `/.nojekyll` marker, which either channel creates when it is missing: the site builds with legacy Jekyll, which would otherwise drop the underscore-named files a Vite build emits and render the README onto the site. See Release and RC channels below.

> The hosted page can't run the **main screen**. The main screen needs to reach your KSP install over a plain `ws://` connection, which a browser blocks from an `https://` page (mixed content), so the main screen always runs locally against your own KSP. What the hosted page is for is **station** screens: a station on someone else's network loads the app from here and joins with the share code.

Requirements:

- The `PAGES_DEPLOY_TOKEN` secret: a fine-grained personal access token with **Contents: read and write** on `ksp-gonogo/ksp-gonogo.github.io` and nothing else. `deploy.yml` fails on its first step when it is missing.
- In `ksp-gonogo/ksp-gonogo.github.io`, Pages source is **Deploy from a branch**, `main` at `/`. This repository's own Pages is off: while it is on, GitHub serves `ksp-gonogo.github.io/gonogo/` from here and the redirects in the site repository are never reached.
- `VITE_AXIOM_TOKEN` is a GitHub Actions secret, passed through in `deploy.yml` so production logs ship to Axiom. Without the secret the log transport silently doesn't install, and local dev never hits Axiom.

Build locally:

```bash
pnpm build         # output lands in packages/app/dist/
```

## Backend image (GHCR)

The relay service is published as a multi-arch (`linux/amd64`, `linux/arm64`) image to GitHub Container Registry by `.github/workflows/publish-images.yml`:

- `ghcr.io/ksp-gonogo/gonogo-relay:latest`

That workflow runs on two triggers and nothing else: `rc.yml` calling it with `channel=rc` (`:rc` + `:sha-...`), and a `workflow_dispatch` carrying `channel=release`, which is how `release.yml` moves `:<version>` and `:latest`. Both channels also tag by commit SHA. A push to a branch publishes no image. Old `:dev` tags stay on GHCR; nothing removes them. This lets you run the relay on a dedicated mission-control box without a Node toolchain (swap `podman` for `docker` if you prefer):

```bash
podman run -d --name gonogo-relay \
  -p 3002:3002 -p 3478:3478/udp -p 3478:3478/tcp -p 49160-49170:49160-49170/udp \
  -e TURN_EXTERNAL_IP=<public-ip> \
  ghcr.io/ksp-gonogo/gonogo-relay:latest
```

The relay's ports, and what a station on another network needs forwarded to reach it, are in the [networking page](https://github.com/ksp-gonogo/gonogo/blob/main/docs/NETWORKING.md#cross-internet-stations-cellular-remote-networks).

The image a player runs is a single one, `ghcr.io/ksp-gonogo/gonogo:latest`, which runs the app and the relay together under one supervisor. It is built from `Dockerfile.bundle` and published by the `publish-bundle` job in `.github/workflows/publish-images.yml`, on the same two triggers and with the same tags as the relay image above.

## Release and RC channels

Everything user-facing moves only when a release is cut. A separate release-candidate (RC) channel is built from the head of `staging` by `rc.yml`, every night at 03:00 UTC and on demand. A push to a branch publishes nothing.

| Surface | Release channel | RC channel (`rc.yml`) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Pages site | `ksp-gonogo.github.io/app/`, with the landing page at the root | `ksp-gonogo.github.io/rc/` (stations: `/rc/station`) |
| Bundle image | `ghcr.io/ksp-gonogo/gonogo:<version>` + `:latest` | `ghcr.io/ksp-gonogo/gonogo:rc` |
| Relay image | `ghcr.io/ksp-gonogo/gonogo-relay:<version>` + `:latest` | `ghcr.io/ksp-gonogo/gonogo-relay:rc` |
| Mod GameData zips | attached to the GitHub Release, and pushed to SpaceDock | built and kept as a CI artifact only (`rc-<shortsha>`) |
| npm packages | `sitrep-sdk` / `ui-kit` / `uplink-tools`, all at `X.Y.Z` | not by `rc.yml`; an opt-in package RC (below) publishes `X.Y.Z-rc.<run>` under the `rc` dist-tag |
| NuGet package | `KspGonogo.Sitrep.Contract` at `X.Y.Z` | not by `rc.yml` (CI packs, gates and probes it); the opt-in package RC publishes `X.Y.Z-rc.<run>` |
| App version | `X.Y.Z` | `X.Y.Z-rc.<shortsha>` |

Both images also carry a `sha-<commit>` tag in both channels. `gonogo` and `gonogo-relay` are the only two images; there is no third service image. The earlier dev channel (`/gonogo/dev/`, `:dev`) is gone, while old `:dev` image tags linger on GHCR.

**How an RC is built.** `rc.yml` checks out `staging` and acts on its head sha:

- it does nothing when `rc-<shortsha>` already exists. That tag is the record of the last RC: it is written only after Pages, images and mod zips all finished, so a failed RC leaves none and the next night retries. The `force` input rebuilds a sha that already has a tag
- it does nothing when the head is a release commit (a `v*` tag points at it)
- it validates the sha before anything publishes. If every CI run of it on `ci-dev` is green (`scripts/ci-dev-forward-verdict.sh`, the forwarder's own rule) the tests are not repeated and the gate passes. Otherwise (no `ci-dev` run, one pending or red, the list unreadable) it calls `ci.yml` against the sha and publishes only if that passes. `ci.yml` is callable (`workflow_call`, `ref` input, every checkout takes it). `staging` gets no CI of its own from the forwarder (a `GITHUB_TOKEN` push starts no workflow), which is why the `ci-dev` run is the usual evidence. `force` bypasses neither. On the called path, a `schedule` or `workflow_dispatch` run has no push `before`, so the shrink-only ratchets grade against `HEAD^` (the last commit only)
- it calls `deploy.yml`, `publish-images.yml` and `publish-mods.yml` with that sha

```bash
gh workflow run rc.yml --ref staging              # build the RC now
gh workflow run rc.yml --ref staging -f force=true
```

**Why `rc.yml` is one self-contained file.** `schedule` runs the copy of a workflow on the default branch, `main`, which moves only at a release. So `rc.yml` is the same file on both branches and behaves by where it runs: a scheduled run is a trampoline that only dispatches `rc.yml` with `--ref staging` and exits, and every real job runs only when `github.ref` is `refs/heads/staging`, using staging's own `ci.yml` and publishers. Only `rc.yml` has to reach `main` for the nightly to start.

**Cutting a release.** One dispatch, on `staging`:

```bash
gh workflow run prepare-release.yml --ref staging
gh workflow run prepare-release.yml --ref staging -f version=X.Y.Z   # an exact version: a reset of the line, or a 1.0
```

`prepare-release.yml` refuses any other ref, and refuses when `main` has commits `staging` lacks (it cannot be fast-forwarded), printing how many. Otherwise it commits the version bump on top of `staging`, which fast-forwards `main` to it, returns the commit to `staging`, and puts it on `ci-dev` too (fast-forward, or a merge commit when `ci-dev` holds work `staging` has not received), so `ci-dev` stays a superset of `staging` and `ci-dev-forward.yml` keeps fast-forwarding. Then it carries on as below.

The `bump` input accepts `auto` (the default), `patch`, `minor` or `major`; force one with `-f bump=minor`. `auto` analyses conventional commits since the last `v*` tag (an `rc-*` tag is not a release), `feat:` → minor, `BREAKING CHANGE`/`!` → major, anything else → patch, and fails the run outright when that range is empty rather than re-cutting an already-released tree. Override it whenever `auto` would understate the change: the bump size *is* the wire-compatibility promise in the skew table below, and `auto` only reads commit subjects. The `version` input replaces the bump with an exact `X.Y.Z`. Whichever way it is chosen, `scripts/release-packages.mjs` refuses the version unless it sorts above every version any published package has on npm or nuget.org and its `v*` tag does not exist yet: a version is spent once, for everything.

**One version for everything.** The release version is `packages/app/package.json`'s, and it is also the version of every published package: `@ksp-gonogo/sitrep-sdk`, `@ksp-gonogo/ui-kit` and `@ksp-gonogo/uplink-tools` on npm and `KspGonogo.Sitrep.Contract` on nuget.org. The release commit moves the three npm manifests with the app's (`scripts/freeze-published-surface.mjs --release`), the NuGet csproj reads the app's manifest, and every packed npm manifest pins its siblings to the same version exactly. The wire contract's `Major.Minor` and `EXTENSION_API_VERSION` are not package versions: they are compatibility stamps the host checks at load and move by their own rules. The contract one is stamped on `Sitrep.Contract.dll` as `SitrepContractVersion` metadata, and the package gate checks it in the packed file.

**What a release moves.** `prepare-release.yml` freezes the published surface ledgers, moves the app and every published package to the release version, commits `release: vX.Y.Z`, tags, pushes the commit and the tag to `main`, returns the release commit to `staging` (so `main` can still be fast-forwarded next time), then dispatches `release.yml` on the tag. `release.yml` runs the full test suite at the tag, and then:

- uploads the production site as the GitHub Release asset `gonogo-site.tar.gz`, and marks that release GitHub's latest explicitly (`/app/` serves whichever release is latest, and GitHub's automatic choice would keep an older higher-numbered one),
- dispatches `publish-images.yml` with `channel=release`, tagging `gonogo` and `gonogo-relay` `:<version>` + `:latest`,
- dispatches `publish-mods.yml` with `channel=release`, attaching each mod GameData zip in that workflow's matrix to the Release and pushing it to SpaceDock (a mod whose `vars.SPACEDOCK_MOD_ID_*` repo variable is unset warns and skips the SpaceDock half instead of failing),
- dispatches `deploy.yml` with `channel=release`, which publishes that asset at `/app/` along with the landing page and the old-URL redirects,
- publishes `@ksp-gonogo/sitrep-sdk`, `@ksp-gonogo/ui-kit` and `@ksp-gonogo/uplink-tools` to npm at the release version, refusing a manifest that is not at it. A version already on npm (a re-run attempt) is skipped, but the skip is checked against the published tarball, so content that moved under a published version fails instead of going quiet.
- publishes `KspGonogo.Sitrep.Contract` to nuget.org at the release version. The `publish-nuget` job packs once with both determinism flags set, gates that file, builds `GonogoProbeUplink` (`scripts/nuget-probe-uplink/`, kept here only to be probed) against it outside the repo (plus a planted gap that must fail), and pushes the same file. When the version IS already on nuget.org (a re-run attempt), it downloads that published copy and compares it against the fresh pack with the build-identity regions (PE timestamp, debug-directory timestamps, PDB id, PDB checksum, module MVID) normalised out; a real difference fails rather than skipping silently. It authenticates through nuget.org trusted publishing, bound to `release.yml` with no environment, and needs the `NUGET_USER` secret: the nuget.org profile name that owns the policy. There is no API key.

**The packages are published as a set.** A release and a candidate both go in this order, and no tag anyone installs by moves until the end: the NuGet package is pushed and the run waits until nuget.org lists it (up to 45 minutes); each npm package is published under the `pending` dist-tag; each is read back from the registry; then one job moves `rc` or `latest` for all three together. A failure anywhere leaves every tag naming the previous set and the run red; run the workflow again to finish it. Moving a tag needs "Allow npm dist-tag" ticked on each package's trusted publisher on npmjs.com. To check that without moving a real tag: `gh workflow run release.yml --ref staging -f rc=true -f dry_run=true -f tag_probe=true`.

**Package release candidates.** Packages get RCs only on demand, from `staging`, through the same `release.yml` that publishes them for real (npm's trusted publishers and nuget.org's policy name that file):

```bash
gh workflow run release.yml --ref staging -f rc=true -f dry_run=true   # everything but the login and the push
gh workflow run release.yml --ref staging -f rc=true                   # publish the RCs
gh workflow run release.yml --ref staging -f rc=true -f version=X.Y.Z  # RCs of an exact release, not the auto bump
```

`rc=true` skips the app release (no tag, no GitHub Release, no images, no Pages) and refuses any ref but `refs/heads/staging`. It commits nothing, bumps nothing in the repo and never freezes a surface ledger. Its `rc-plan` job works out the RC with `scripts/release-packages.mjs plan` and proves the set:

- the RC is a prerelease of the NEXT release, worked out exactly as `prepare-release.yml` would (or the `version` input), and refused on the same rule. The suffix is `-rc.<workflow run number>`, unique per run and increasing, and all four packages carry the same one. When an RC was cut for an exact `version`, give `prepare-release.yml` the same one
- each npm manifest pins every `@ksp-gonogo` sibling to that RC exactly. `ui-kit` and `uplink-tools` import the sdk without declaring it (a workspace peer breaks the workspace's own resolution), so the stamp declares that edge as an exact peer, at a release as well as an RC
- a package that has never been published gets the RC as its first version: npm may make that first version `latest` whatever the tag, and the job summary says where `latest` points afterwards
- `published-packages-probe.mjs --version <rc>` installs the three stamped tarballs together outside the workspace, so a pin that does not resolve fails before anything publishes

Then `publish-packages` packs each package exactly as a release does, stamps the RC onto the tarball, runs `verify-package-artifact.mjs` and `release-packages.mjs check` on that file, publishes it with `--tag rc` and fails if npm's `latest` moved for a package that already had one. `publish-nuget` packs with `-p:PackageVersion=<RC>` (the assemblies keep their contract stamp), runs the package gate with `--rc`, the extraction probe and its planted gap, and pushes only an `-rc.` version. A re-run attempt keeps its run number, so a package an earlier attempt published is skipped, and the fossil check compares that copy as it does for a release. The matrix does not fail fast, so a run where one package failed leaves its siblings' exact pins unresolvable until that job is re-run.

An outside author installs them together with `npm install @ksp-gonogo/sitrep-sdk@rc @ksp-gonogo/ui-kit@rc @ksp-gonogo/uplink-tools@rc` (the pins are exact, so an RC beside a release of a sibling fails peer resolution), or a NuGet `PackageReference` with the exact `-rc.<n>` version.

The version in `packages/app/package.json`, and with it every published package's, only ever changes through this flow. Never hand-edit any of them in either direction: `release.yml` refuses a tag that disagrees with the app's version and a package manifest that disagrees with the tag, so an edit breaks the next release rather than undoing the last one.

The release commit is pushed with `GITHUB_TOKEN`, and token pushes do not fire workflow triggers, so **CI never runs on the release commit**, and therefore `rc.yml` builds no RC for it either. Each publisher is dispatched by `release.yml` explicitly, in the order above; there is no second Pages run racing the release.

**How the Pages site holds both channels:** each channel is its own `deploy.yml` run writing its own directory. The rc channel builds the app (base `/rc/`, `-rc.<shortsha>` suffix) from the commit it is given and replaces `/rc/`. The release channel downloads the newest release's `gonogo-site.tar.gz` (built by `release.yml` with base `/app/`), replaces `/app/` with it, and rewrites the landing page and the redirects from the commit it runs on. Neither reads or removes the other's directory, so a release leaves the RC exactly as the last RC run left it. A site asset built before the move to `/app/` cannot be served from there, and the release channel refuses one.

**Checking a release landed.** A release fans out into three further workflow runs, so `release.yml` going green is not the whole answer:

```bash
gh run list --limit 10                                     # release.yml plus what it dispatched
gh release view v<X.Y.Z> --json assets --jq '.assets[].name'

curl -s https://ksp-gonogo.github.io/app/ | grep gonogo-version
curl -s https://ksp-gonogo.github.io/rc/  | grep gonogo-version
```

Every build stamps `<meta name="gonogo-version">` and `<meta name="gonogo-build-time">` into the page shell for exactly this, so both channels can be read without dev-tools. The same string is baked into the JS as `__GONOGO_VERSION__` and announced in the peer `hello` handshake. For the images, `podman pull ghcr.io/ksp-gonogo/gonogo:<version>` proves the tag exists, and a running relay answers `GET /version`.

**Rolling back.** There is no undo command, and the sanctioned move is forward: fix, and cut the next release. If `/app/` has to serve the previous release *now*, demote the bad one and publish again, because `/app/` follows whatever GitHub calls the latest release and a pre-release is not it. This only reaches back as far as the first release built for `/app/`: an older site asset was built for `/gonogo/` and the release channel refuses it.

```bash
gh release edit v<bad> --prerelease
gh workflow run deploy.yml --ref main -f channel=release           # /app/ falls back to the previous release asset
gh workflow run publish-images.yml --ref v<previous> -f channel=release   # moves :latest back
```

Two things do not come back. An npm or NuGet publish cannot be undone, so a bad `ui-kit`, `sitrep-sdk` or `KspGonogo.Sitrep.Contract` needs a further version (nuget.org can unlist a version, which hides it from search but still serves it to anyone who pinned it). And a version number is spent once: undoing a bump by editing `packages/app/package.json` only desynchronises it from the tags, so roll forward past a bad version instead.

**Version-skew detection:** Vite bakes the version into the build (`__GONOGO_VERSION__`), the host announces it in the peer `hello` handshake, stations report theirs back in `station-info`. Stations render a mismatch banner per the table below, and the main screen's GO/NO-GO grid shows a version chip per skewed station. The bump size states the wire-compatibility promise:

| Bump | Meaning | Station UX against a skewed host |
| --- | --- | --- |
| patch | wire-compatible fix | silent (log line only) |
| minor | new features, still interoperates | advisory mismatch banner |
| major | peer protocol broke | mismatch banner; expect breakage |

RC builds compare by their base `X.Y.Z` (the `-rc.<shortsha>` suffix is ignored), so an RC station against the release it forked from is silent. Because stations always load the newest deploy of their channel while main screens run a container pulled at install time, skew is normal, the banner is the nudge to `docker pull`. When changing the peer protocol, keep new message fields optional (the codebase already follows this) so a minor-skewed pair degrades instead of crashing.

**One caveat for RC testing:** `/app/` and `/rc/` share an origin, so an RC station and a release station on the same device share localStorage, layout, station identity, share-code. Convenient (your station keeps its identity across channels) but an RC-channel layout experiment edits the same saved layout the release station uses.
